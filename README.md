# 👋 Hi, I’m Huiling!

I’m an undergraduate Computer Science student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), focusing on **graphics, interactive systems, intelligent agents, and practical software engineering**.

The main works I intend to highlight are listed below.

---

## 🎨 Virtual Pottery using Hand Tracking  
**(Unity, Ultraleap Hand Tracking)**  

A real-time gesture-to-surface deformation system using bare-hand tracking.  
Includes temporal filtering, falloff shaping, normal-aligned displacement, and stability improvements to handle jitter and fast-motion loss.  

👉 **[virtual-sculpting-leapmotion](#)**

---

## 🧭 Multiversal Studios Interactive Theme Park Trip Planner  
**(Prototyping, UX, Systems Thinking)**  

Design and implementation of an information-rich interactive interface with attention to learnability, flow, and error prevention.  
Includes iterative prototyping, interaction modeling, and structured evaluation.  

👉 **[interactive-kiosk-hci](#)**

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Workflow Automation Project  
**(Python, APIs, System Integration)**  

A lightweight agent-based pipeline that coordinates external tools for small-molecule exploration.  
Focuses on modular task orchestration, data flow design, and robust error handling.  

👉 **[DDagent](#)**

---

## 📅 NTU Course Planner  
**(Python / Web)**  

A practical tool that assists with course scheduling, conflict detection, and degree planning.  
Emphasizes clean data modeling, UI logic, and maintainable software structure.  

👉 **[iNTUition-10 / ORBITs](#)**
